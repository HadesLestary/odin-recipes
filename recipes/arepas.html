                <h3> Ingredients</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                        <li>1 cup pre cooked white cornmeal (Maseca is best)</li>
                        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>cooking spray or butter</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Mix water, cornmeal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl.
                            <br> Knead until well combined and a soft dough forms. Form dough into balls the size of a medium orange.
                            <br>Place each ball between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin to the desired thickness.</li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>
                            Leaving plastic wrap in place, press the top edge of a cereal bowl or drinking glass
                            <br> into the surface of the dough to cut circles. Remove the plastic wrap and 
                            <br>remove any excess dough scraps.</li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>
                            Spray a griddle with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat.
                            <br> Working in batches, cook arepas on the hot griddle until golden brown, 
                            <br>about 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
