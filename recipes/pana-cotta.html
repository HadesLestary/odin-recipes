                    <p>Panna cotta literally means "cooked cream," and that's about all it is!

                    <ul>
                        <p><h4>For the panna cotta:</h4></p>

                            <li>Vegetable oil, or vegetable oil spray (for the molds)</li>

                            <li>3 tsp unflavored gelatin powder</li>
                            <li>3 cups heavy milk</li>
                            <li>1/3 cup (67g) sugar</li>
                            <li>pingh of salt</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
                            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>

                        <p><h4>For the sauce and berries:</h4></p>

                            <li>1 12-ounce package (about 3 cups) frozen raspberries, defrosted</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons sugar </li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons orange juice</li>
                            <li>2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, sliced strawberries, or a mix</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4> Prepare the molds:</h4>
                            Lightly brush or spray six 6-ounce ramekins with oil. <br>
                            (Skip this step if you are planning to serve straight from the dishes.)
                            <p></p>
                            Place the ramekins on a baking sheet for easy transfer of the panna cotta 
                            <br>from the counter to the fridge.</li>

                        <li><h4> Soften the gelatin:</h4>
                            Pour the milk into a medium mixing bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over top.
                            <br> Stir with a fork to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes without stirring 
                            <br>to allow the gelatin to soften. (It will look like curdled milk or milky applesauce.)</li>

                        <li><h4> Warm the cream and sugar:</h4>
                            In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream, sugar, and salt to a simmer.
                            <br> Stir frequently until the sugar is dissolved and the milk is just starting to steam.
                            <br> Do not let it come to a boil (if it does, let it cool slightly before continuing to the next step).</li>

                        <li><h4> Whisk the cream into the gelatin:</h4>
                            Slowly pour the hot cream over the gelatin, whisking as you go in order to dissolve the gelatin.
                            <br> Rub a little of the cream mixture between your fingers to make sure the gelatin has dissolved;
                            <br> it should feel smooth, not grainy.</li>

                        <li><h4> Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla until smooth</h4></li>

                        <li><h4> Fill and chill the molds:</h4>
                            Divide the panna cotta mixture between the ramekins.
                            <br> Transfer to the ramekins to the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours until set, or overnight.</li>

                        <li><h4> Make the raspberry sauce:</h4>
                            Close to when you're ready to serve, puree the raspberries, sugar and
                            <br> orange juice in a blender until smooth. Pass through a fine meshed strainer to remove the seeds.
                            <br> Set aside or refrigerate until needed. (This sauce can also be made several days in advance and kept refrigerated.)</li>

                        <li><h4> Unmold the panna cotta:</h4>
                            Slide a paring knife around the edge of each ramekin. Place a 
                            <br>dessert plate upside-down over the top of the ramekin.
                            <br> Holding the plate in position, flip it over so the ramekin is now upside down
                            <br> on top of the plate. Slowly lift the ramekin at a slight angle to release the panna cotta.
                            <p></p>
                            Spoon some of the sauce around the panna cotta and sprinkle with berries.
                            <br> (If you're serving straight from the dish, spoon some of the sauce over top and sprinkle with berries.)</li>
                            
                    </ol>
